# Discord-Ban-List-Downloader
Simple bot to download your servers ban list to a .txt file 
A Great way to be able to post to a channel after you download the file to have a tag to open user profile to see if they are in other servers you may be a mod/admin in. 

To add a tag in a logging channel use <@USERID> 

How to use this bot 

.env is for your bots token 
 bot.py enter your owner id for bot & others you want to access the bot. 
Under bot.py enter the servers id so it can work. 

then once the bot is up and running you use / command to get the list of bans ( Only you can see this )

And I know this type up is bad I never been good at making a read.me
